existential threat: what ensures this project will be maintained in the future?
Today, Linkerd adopters can be confident they&amp;rsquo;re getting the world&amp;rsquo;s simplest,
fastest, lightest service mesh. Can they be confident they&amp;rsquo;re getting a project
that will be around tomorrow? Another decade?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are not theoretical questions. The past 18 months alone have provided many
examples of just how fragile open source can be:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Linkerd Edge Release Roundup: October 2024</title><link>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/10/15/linkerd-edge-release-roundup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Flynn</author><guid>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/10/15/linkerd-edge-release-roundup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the October 2024 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into the

&lt;p>Edge releases are a snapshot of our current development work on &lt;code>main&lt;/code>; by
definition, they always have the most recent features but they may have
incomplete features, features that end up getting rolled back later, or (like
all software) even bugs. That said, edge releases &lt;em>are&lt;/em> intended for production
use, and go through a rigorous set of automated and manual tests before being
released.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Linkerd Edge Release Roundup: September 2024</title><link>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/09/06/linkerd-edge-release-roundup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Flynn</author><guid>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/09/06/linkerd-edge-release-roundup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the September 2024 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into the

routes; IPv6 support; policy audit mode; and lots more</title><link>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/08/13/announcing-linkerd-2.16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>William Morgan</author><guid>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/08/13/announcing-linkerd-2.16/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today we&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce &lt;a href="https://travisbeckham.github.io/releases/#linkerd-216">Linkerd 2.16&lt;/a>, a major
step forward for Linkerd that adds a whole host of new features, including
support for IPv6; an &amp;ldquo;audit mode&amp;rdquo; for Linkerd&amp;rsquo;s zero trust security policies; a
new implementation of retries, timeouts, and per-route metrics for HTTPRoute and
GPRCRoute resources; and much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-route-metrics-retries-and-timeouts">New route metrics, retries, and timeouts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The 2.16 release continues our goal of ensuring Linkerd is the truly
&lt;em>future-proof service mesh.&lt;/em> We expect the
&lt;a href="https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gateway API&lt;/a> to emerge as the standard for
traffic configuration in the Kubernetes space, and when that happens, Linkerd
users will be ready. (Of course, we&amp;rsquo;re also actively involved in the Gateway API
to ensure the evolving design continues to make sense for Linkerd users!)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Linkerd Edge Release Roundup: August 2024</title><link>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/08/05/linkerd-edge-release-roundup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Flynn</author><guid>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/08/05/linkerd-edge-release-roundup/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the August 2024 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into the

EU&lt;/a>,
Microsoft announced the &lt;a href="https://smi-spec.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Service Mesh Interface&lt;/a> (SMI).
SMI is a specification that exposes core service mesh features like telemetry,
traffic shifting, and policy, purely via Kubernetes primitives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Linkerd community has been working heavily with our friends from Microsoft
and Hashicorp on SMI for the past few months. In fact, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/deislabs/smi-spec/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top two
contributors to SMI&lt;/a>
are Linkerd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/grampelberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Rampelberg&lt;/a> and
Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/nicholasjackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Jackson&lt;/a>&amp;mdash;a healthy sign
of serious community involvement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Secure, Reliable, Observable IDP with Backstage &amp; Linkerd</title><link>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/05/23/building-a-secure-reliable-observable-idp-with-backstage-linkerd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Catherine Paganini</author><guid>https://travisbeckham.github.io/2024/05/23/building-a-secure-reliable-observable-idp-with-backstage-linkerd/</guid><description>&lt;p>Smooth workflows are critical in the cloud-native world. This CNCF Cloud Native
Live session explores building a rock-solid Internal Developer Platform (IDP)
Backstage that empowers developers with self-service tools while
streamliningÂ security and observability. Watch the recording with Linkerd Tech
Evangelist Flynn and Backstage Maintainer Ben Lambert as they show you how a
service mesh like Linkerd can supercharge your IDP, ensuring seamless
communication and clear visibility.&lt;/p>
