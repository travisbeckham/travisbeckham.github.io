<a href=https://www.envoyproxy.io target=_blank rel=noopener>Envoy</a>.</p><p>This is a bit of a weird article to write. After all, there are a million
projects that Linkerd <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> use, and none of those decisions deserve a blog
post. But the fact that Linkerd doesn&rsquo;t use Envoy specifically has become a
common enough topic of discussion that it probably deserves a good explanation.</p><p>Let me also state upfront that this is not an &ldquo;Envoy sucks&rdquo; blog post. Envoy is
a great project, is clearly a popular choice for many, and we have nothing but
respect for the fine folks who work on it. We recommend Envoy to Linkerd users
every day in the form of ingress controllers like
<a href=https://github.com/datawire/ambassador target=_blank rel=noopener>Ambassador</a>, and there are production
systems around the world today where you can find Envoy and Linkerd working
side by side.</p><p>But we chose not to build Linkerd on top of Envoy. Instead, we built a
dedicated &ldquo;micro-proxy&rdquo;, called simply
<a href=https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy target=_blank rel=noopener>Linkerd2-proxy</a>, which is optimized
for the service mesh sidecar use case. In the increasingly crowded field of
similar-sounding service mesh projects, Linkerd is unique in this regard. But
why did we go this route?</p><p>The full answer to this question is nuanced and technical at heart—exactly the
kind of content that tends to get swept away in the faddish, blog-post-driven
world of cloud native adoption.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> So in this article I&rsquo;m going to do my best
to lay out the reasons why in a frank and engineering-focused way. After all,
Linkerd is built <em>by</em> engineers and <em>for</em> engineers, and if there&rsquo;s one thing
I&rsquo;m proud of, it&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;ve made decisions on the basis of engineering
tradeoffs rather than marketing pressure.</p><p>In short: <strong>Linkerd doesn&rsquo;t use Envoy because using Envoy wouldn&rsquo;t allow us to
build the lightest, simplest, and most secure Kubernetes service mesh in the
world.</strong></p><p>Being the lightest, simplest, most secure Kubernetes service mesh is Linkerd&rsquo;s
promise to our users, and that&rsquo;s also what makes Linkerd unique among service
meshes: it <em>is</em> dramatically simpler, lighter, and more secure. And the
reason we&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish that is—you guessed it—because we build on
Linkerd2-proxy instead of Envoy. Not because Envoy is bad, but because
Linkerd2-proxy is <em>better</em>—at least, for the very specific and limited use case
of being a Kubernetes sidecar proxy.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at why.</p><h3 id=what-is-linkerd2-proxy>What is Linkerd2-proxy?</h3><p>Before we get into the details, it&rsquo;s helpful to understand a bit more about
Linkerd2-proxy.</p><p>Linkerd2-proxy is a &ldquo;micro-proxy&rdquo; designed specifically for the service mesh
sidecar use case. Linkerd2-proxy is built on, and has driven many of the
requirements for, the world&rsquo;s most modern network programming environment circa
2020: the Rust asynchronous network ecosystem, including libraries like
<a href=https://tokio.rs/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Tokio</a>, <a href=https://github.com/tower-rs target=_blank rel=noopener>Tower</a>, and
<a href=https://github.com/hyperium/hyper target=_blank rel=noopener>Hyper</a>. In terms of sheer technical
advancement, Linkerd2-proxy is one of the most advanced pieces of technology in
the entire CNCF landscape.</p><p>Like Envoy, Linkerd2-proxy is a 100% open source Apache v2 CNCF project that
features regular third-party audits, an active community, and high-scale
production usage in mission-critical systems around the world. Unlike Envoy,
Linkerd2-proxy is designed for only one use case: proxying requests to and from
a single Kubernetes pod while receiving configuration from the Linkerd control
plane. And unlike Envoy, Linkerd2-proxy is designed to be an <em>implementation
detail</em>: it&rsquo;s not user-facing, it&rsquo;s not usable as a generic building block, and
it has a boring name. This means Linkerd2-proxy tends to go unnoticed, though
we&rsquo;ve tried to shed a little more light on it recently with articles looking
<a href=https://linkerd.io/2020/07/23/under-the-hood-of-linkerds-state-of-the-art-rust-proxy-linkerd2-proxy/ target=_blank rel=noopener>under the
hood</a>
and at <a href=https://linkerd.io/2020/09/02/the-road-ahead-for-linkerd2-proxy/ target=_blank rel=noopener>the
roadmap</a>).</p><p>So why &ldquo;micro-proxy&rdquo;? Loathe as we are to introduce another term into the
lexicon,<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> the word &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do Linkerd2-proxy justice. A proxy is
something like Envoy, NGINX, Apache, or httproxy. These projects can do a huge
variety of things (&ldquo;send HTTP requests with a path that matches this wildcard
to this backend while rewriting these headers, compressing any Javascript
files, and rotating the access logs&rdquo;) and they have a configuration and tuning
surface area to match. Using a proxy in production requires significant
operational investment: if you&rsquo;re running Apache, you&rsquo;re going to end up with
an Apache expert somewhere in the house.</p><p>But Linkerd2-proxy is different. It&rsquo;s designed to be an implementation detail
that doesn&rsquo;t require specialized knowledge or dedicated operational investment
(though Linkerd as a whole, of course, does require it). There&rsquo;s no user-facing
YAML; instead, Linkerd2-proxy is configured automatically through a handful of
environment variables set at injection time and by the Linkerd control plane at
runtime. We&rsquo;ve kept Linkerd2-proxy&rsquo;s tuning surface area to a bare minimum so
that end users rarely have to touch it directly. In short: Linkerd2-proxy is
designed to stay behind the scenes, to be an implementation detail, and to just
work.</p><p><em>Tl;dr</em>: Linkerd2-proxy is dramatically different from proxies like Envoy,
NGINX, and Apache, and the word &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do it justice.</p><h3 id=complexity>Complexity</h3><p>So why did we build Linkerd2-proxy rather than using Envoy? One big reason is
complexity.</p><p>Envoy is a flexible and general-purpose proxy, and that&rsquo;s much of the reason for
its popularity. You can use Envoy as an ingress, as an egress, as a service mesh
sidecar, and in many other ways. But with this flexibility comes complexity.</p><p>As a point of comparison, as of November 2020, the Envoy repo weighs in at <strong>172
KLOC</strong> of C++ code, with a &ldquo;complexity score&rdquo; (measured in terms of branches and
loops) of <strong>19k</strong>.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> By contrast, Linkerd2-proxy comes in at <strong>30 KLOC</strong> and
has a complexity score of <strong>1.5k</strong>. In other words: the Linkerd2-proxy codebase
is 5 times smaller than Envoy and, by this measure, its complexity is ten times
less than Envoy&rsquo;s.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></p><p>This isn&rsquo;t an apples-to-apples calculation, of course. It doesn&rsquo;t capture the
libraries or dependencies outside the repos; the complexity score numbers are
not strictly portable across languages; and so on. But it should give you a
general sense of the relative size of these projects: internally, Linkerd2-proxy
is <em>orders of magnitude smaller and simpler than Envoy</em>.</p><p>Is this complexity a moral failing in Envoy? No. Again, Envoy has a lot of
complex code because it can do a lot of complex things. However, this complexity
is a very difficult foundation upon which to build a project that is focused on
simplicity, especially operational simplicity.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p><p><em>Tl;dr</em>: Envoy is a Swiss Army knife. Linkerd2-proxy is a needle.</p><h3 id=resource-consumption>Resource consumption</h3><p>One thing is clear with any sidecar-based service mesh: you&rsquo;re going to have a
lot of proxies.</p><p>That means that the aggregate CPU and memory consumed by the data plane are a
critical component of the <em>cost</em> of running a service mesh, especially as the
application scales.</p><p>Using Linkerd2-proxy allows us to keep tight reins on Linkerd&rsquo;s resource
consumption. In our internal benchmarks of Linkerd and Istio using
<a href=https://github.com/kinvolk/service-mesh-benchmark target=_blank rel=noopener>Kinvolk&rsquo;s open source benchmark
harness</a>, for example, at
4,000 RPS (requests per second) of ingress traffic, we see Linkerd2-proxy
instances consistently between <strong>14mb</strong> and <strong>15mb</strong> of memory, while Istio&rsquo;s
Envoy ranged between <strong>135mb</strong> and <strong>175mb</strong>—ten times the size. Similarly,
Linkerd2-proxy&rsquo;s CPU usage for the test run was consistently at <strong>15ms</strong> (CPU
milliseconds) per instance, while Istio&rsquo;s Envoy ranged from <strong>22ms</strong> to
<strong>156ms</strong>—from 50% more to 10x more.</p><p>Again, this is not an entirely fair comparison. These are internal benchmarks
against one particular application and one particular configuration, and
undoubtedly some of Istio&rsquo;s design decisions played a big role here. But Istio
is built by world-class engineers, and the point is: if Linkerd were built on
Envoy, we&rsquo;d have to make many of those same design decisions ourselves.</p><p><em>Tl;dr</em>: In practice, in the service mesh context, Linkerd2-proxy uses a
fraction of the system resources that Envoy does.</p><h3 id=security>Security</h3><p>The last point is perhaps the most philosophical: security. The security of the
data plane is a <em>huge</em> concern for any service mesh. Linkerd, for example, is
used in production around the world to handle extraordinarily sensitive data,
from health information to personally-identifiable details to financial
transactions.</p><p>We have no reason to believe that Envoy is insecure. But to the extent that it
<em>is</em> secure (especially at 170+ KLOC of C++ code), it&rsquo;s secure via the manual
and expensive process of getting a lot of very smart engineers using it,
examining it, filing CVEs, fixing bugs, and repeating. This is the &ldquo;traditional
process&rdquo; for software security, and it works—at least, in the fullness of time.
It is also expensive, difficult, and failure prone. C++ code is
<a href=https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mgxb/the-internet-has-a-huge-cc-problem-and-developers-dont-want-to-deal-with-it target=_blank rel=noopener>notoriously</a>
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow#Choice_of_programming_language target=_blank rel=noopener>difficult</a>
to
<a href=https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/ target=_blank rel=noopener>secure</a>,
even for the most experienced programmers.</p><p>More fundamentally, this is not the security model we want to rely on for
Linkerd and not what we believe is the future of systems programming security.
Our choice of Rust for Linkerd2-proxy was intentional: Rust&rsquo;s memory safety
allows us to confidently write secure code in Linkerd2-proxy in a way that
minimizes our reliance on humans catching the problems. Which is not to say that
Linkerd2-proxy cannot have security vulnerabilities, of course! Rather, that it
will have fewer; that we will need to rely less on our own humble talents to
avoid them; and that we will less often need to impose on our users to upgrade
their systems with critical updates in order to remain secure.</p><p><em>Tl;dr</em>: Linkerd2-proxy&rsquo;s Rust foundations give us confidence in the security of
Linkerd&rsquo;s data plane.</p><h2 id=could-linkerd-use-envoy>Could Linkerd use Envoy?</h2><p>Simplicity, resource consumption, and security were the driving factors in our
decision to not adopt Envoy. However, we do believe that the choice of proxy is
ultimately an implementation detail. While we&rsquo;ve invested tremendous amounts in
Linkerd2-proxy, we do periodically re-evaluate Envoy. I can say with
clarity that if the tradeoff for our users ever tips in Envoy&rsquo;s favor, we will
adopt it without qualms.</p><p>Our advice to would-be service mesh adopters, though, is simple: ignore the
noise. Your job is not to &ldquo;use a service mesh&rdquo; or &ldquo;adopt Envoy&rdquo; or even &ldquo;use
only CNCF technology&rdquo;. Your job is to clearly understand the problem you&rsquo;re
trying to solve and then to pick the solution that solves it best. And whatever
you pick, you&rsquo;re going to have to live with it—so make sure you&rsquo;re making a
decision based on concrete requirements and well-understood engineering
tradeoffs, not on fashion or trends.</p><h2 id=faq>FAQ</h2><h3 id=so-why-_do_-so-many-service-meshes-use-envoy>So why <em>do</em> so many service meshes use Envoy?</h3><p>Because writing your own modern, scalable, high-performance network
(micro-)proxy is <em>hard</em>. It&rsquo;s <em>really hard</em>. Building out Linkerd2-proxy and
the Rust networking libraries that make it possible has been a tremendous
effort from a many people for the past several years. Unless your project has
both the technical prowess and the <em>desire</em> to tackle this challenge, it&rsquo;s much
easier to just use Envoy.</p><h3 id=but-isnt-envoy-a-standard-for-service-meshes>But isn&rsquo;t Envoy a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for service meshes?</h3><p>No.<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> A <em>standard</em> is something that is necessary for interoperability. The
<em>standard</em> that matters for service meshes is TCP, or HTTP, or things like
<a href=https://smi-spec.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>SMI</a> that allow tools to be built on top of the service
mesh. (E.g. this excellent example of <a href=https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/getting-started/smi/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Argo driving Linkerd via SMI for canary
rollouts</a>.)</p><p>Envoy being a popular choice of service mesh data plane proxy is not a
standard, it&rsquo;s simply a commonality. What would it mean for Envoy to be a
&ldquo;service mesh standard&rdquo;? That we could keep our data plane in place, and swap
out the control plane? That we can have different control planes operate the
same data plane? These are far-fetched use cases at best.</p><h3 id=but-what-if-we-have-a-requirement-to-use-envoy>But what if we have a requirement to use Envoy?</h3><p>I would argue that&rsquo;s not a real requirement. Your job is not to adopt a
particular piece of technology. Your job is to solve a problem.</p><p>And if your problem is &ldquo;we need to build a reliable, secure, and observable
Kubernetes platform without paying an insane complexity cost&rdquo; then I highly
suggest you consider taking a look at Linkerd.</p><h3 id=who-uses-linkerd2-proxy-in-production-today>Who uses Linkerd2-proxy in production today?</h3><p>Everyone who uses Linkerd uses Linkerd2-proxy. That means that you can find
Linkerd2-proxy powering the critical production architecture of companies like
Nordstrom, Microsoft, H-E-B, Chase, Clover Health, HP, any many more.</p><h3 id=could-other-service-mesh-projects-use-linkerd2-proxy>Could other service mesh projects use Linkerd2-proxy?</h3><p>Not really. But anyone who is interested in building a high performance
ultralight network proxy could certainly make use of the underlying Rust
network libraries that power Linkerd.</p><h3 id=sounds-amazing-how-can-i-get-started-with-linkerd>Sounds amazing! How can I get started with Linkerd?</h3><p>I never thought you&rsquo;d ask. You can install Linkerd in about 5 minutes, including
mutual TLS, with zero configuration required. Start with our
